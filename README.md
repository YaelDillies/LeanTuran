# extremal_graph

Turan's theorem is one of the basic results of extremal graph theory so I thought it might be a good place to start if I wanted to learn Lean.

Several lines of code later I'm not sure how much Lean I've learnt but it's been fun!

Main theorem(s) are in https://github.com/jt496/extremal_graph/blob/master/src/theorems.lean
